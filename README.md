# project-template
I'm typically way too lazy to fully set up a project every time I do an analysis, so I wanted to create a project-template repository I could clone every time I started something new. This template is set up to run using the R targets methodology, but enables a user to export code from an exploratory .Rmd file into the functions.R file. Also included are folders for raw data, cleaned data, tidy data, figures, and notes. 

Feel free to fork and use for your own personal needs, classes, etc. Credit is appreciated but not required.


I'm linking some of the resources that contributed to the design of this repository below.
